I’ve spent money on some pretty ridiculous things in my life looking back at it. Can you relate?

It’s so easy to find ourselves spending money on silly things that at the end of the day provide no real value for our lives or the future.

At AOV we work hard to create amazing content for the community. Were actively working hard on creating new AOV educational resources to help everyone in the community grow into who or what they wish to become.

In the meantime, we’ve partnered with an amazing educational based company to offer you guys an insane deal on learning.

Today I present you the best investment you could ever make in yourself for less than $1.

SkillShare and Art of Visuals have teamed up to offer you, the AOV community, 3 months of SkillShare for only $0.99 yup, 99 cents.  No commitment and you can cancel anytime, what do you have to lose?
