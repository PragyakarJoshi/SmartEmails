Every visitor to a website arrives there via its home page. Yet, for many small sites, this page is often poorly thought out since it's not entirely clear what should go there. How can you create an effective home page design when you're not even sure what to put on it?

Other common pages are more obvious:
About page? Talk about yourself or business.
Contact page? Provide contact info.
Store page? List a bunch of products you'd like people to buy.
So then, what about your home page?

The short answer is your home page should tell visitors exactly what it is you do then direct those visitors to the action you most want them to take.

To get started, write one to two sentences describing the service or products you provide. The shorter this description, the better. Then add it to your header or place it directly below.

Let's take a look at two members of the Weebly community to see how they improved home page design to attract action and more sales.
