It's been just over 24 hours since we introduced the NEW Motion Picture Film LUTs and clearly we're on to something good here...

If you're looking to create work that gets noticed... or you're looking to do get a big expensive motion picture look the EASY WAY... then the new Motion Picture Film LUTs are exactly what you're looking for.

We worked really hard to truly capture the look and feel of the films they were inspired from and we feel confident that you will see that in your footage.

I had a really hard time developing looks when I was first getting started in color grading.  I really wanted my work to stand out but creating looks that I felt proud of and excited about was elusive and that was really frustrating.

I was stuck…

And I felt this way until I found artists who inspired me and were willing to share with me their looks in the form of grading presets.

Not only did this help to quickly elevate the look of my work but it also helped me develop my own signature style and taste as I was able to modify the looks and learn how they were created.

This felt exhilarating to make this break through!

It meant a lot to me early on in my career to have that help which is why I’m super excited to share with you LUTs inspired by 22 iconic looking Hollywood films and television shows (based on your feedback):
