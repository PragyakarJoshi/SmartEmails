Hi everyone

Just to let you know I have a Kickstarter project to create an awesome Udemy Course and I would love for you to back it please!

The idea is to create a real iPhone App which will be live in the App Store, then create a Udemy course thats shows you exactly how the app was built. I believe this is something quite unique. Because rather than just learning how to build an app or an app clone, you will be learning exactly how to build a real live App.

To back this project please go to the Kickstarter website and search for "Learn how to build an iPhone App". I can't include the URL here unfortunately.



Also, don't forgot my New Year New You promotion. My 4 Premium Courses are reduced from 49.99 to just 9.99 (80% OFF), but hurry, this offer won't last forever...so purchase today...
