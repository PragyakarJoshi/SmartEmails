Remote Year's Curated Collection

Hey Pragyakar,

This week's collection is a special set of 10 photos chosen by the Remote Year team.

Remote Year is combining work and travel, hoping to change the standard 9am-5pm work environment to show that great work can be done from anywhere. We found this concept refreshing and partnered with them to create this curated collection around the theme “Inspiring Places”.
