Click the button below if you're i= nterested in competing, or digging deeper into the specifics. =0A Competiti= on Description: You=E2=80=99re challenged to create a model that can identi= fy a range of nuclei across varied conditions. By automating nucleus detect= ion, you could help unlock cures faster=E2=80=94from rare disorders to the = common cold. =0A Why nuclei=3F Identifying the cells=E2=80=99 nuclei is the=  starting point for most analyses. Most of the human body=E2=80=99s 30 tril= lion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs ea= ch cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual = cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, t= he researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work. = =0A The solution to this competition will allow for more efficient drug tes= ting, shortening the 10 years it takes for each new drug to come to market.=  =0A Host: Booz Allen Hamilton and the Carpenter Lab at the Broad Institute=  of Harvard and MIT. =0A Booz Allen Hamilton is a large management and tech= nology consulting firm, working with leading Fortune 500 corporations, gove= rnments, and not-for-profits globally. The Carpenter Lab is a research grou= p focused on developing advanced methods and software tools to quantify and=  mine cellular images to yield biological discoveries. =0A[Inline Image] To= tal prizes: $100,000 =0A Next important deadline: April 9th, 2018 - Entry d= eadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to=  compete. =0A Join the competition =0A Good luck, The Kaggle Team=0A=0A --_----ji+UJkdUXLK8J1kh+ANdEQ===_02/F2-08244-28D8E5A5 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
